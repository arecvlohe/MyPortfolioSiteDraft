  <h3>Hello. I am Adam Reklow.</h3>
  <p>I love learning. I love learning so much I taught myself how to code. In the process I learned to build
    <u>dynamic web applications</u> and
    <u>static web sites</u>. My work history certainly shows my support for diversity and the importance of education. Now I work to bring together my esoteric career into one coherent whole; using all facets of my eclectic life.
